			<h2>About Kendrick</h2>

					<p>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and songwriter from Compton, California. Known for his storytelling, imagery, wordplay, passion and varied song structures, Kendrick brings hard-hitting lyricism with narratives to the West Coast, not traditionally known for its lyricists. Kendrick Lamar’s position within the rap game is held incredibly high. He has been nominated for 29 Grammy Awards and has won 12 of them; with two for Best Rap Album. He is also the only rapper to win all of the Grammy Awards in the rap field at the same ceremony, doing so in 2016 and 2018.Lamar is a member of the hip-hop collective Black Hippy, along with Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul—all of whom came up together as a part of Top Dawg Entertainment; however, in 2022, it was announced that Kendrick would be departing TDE following the release of his fifth studio album. He is also signed to Dr. Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment imprint, under Interscope Records. In February of 2018, Kendrick and TDE released Black Panther: The Album (Music from and Inspired by). It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. In April, later the same year, he won the Pulitzer Prize in music for his album, DAMN. Several years of relative inactivity followed, with Kendrick only resurfacing for features or collaborative efforts. In March of 2020, Lamar and Dave Free launched PgLang, a production company whose name stands for “program language.” In August 2021, Kendrick launched a new website, where he proceeded to announce the release date for his next project in April of 2022. Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers appeared on Friday, May 13, as promised—a double album five years in the making.</p>

					<p>Overly Dedicated includes a song titled "Ignorance Is Bliss", in which Lamar glorifies gangsta rap and street crime, but ends each verse with "ignorance is bliss", giving the message "we know not what we do". It was this song specifically that made fellow West Coast rapper and legendary hip hop producer Dr. Dre, want to work with Lamar, after watching the song's music video on YouTube. This led to Lamar working with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg on Dre's Detox album and him considering signing to Dre's label, Aftermath Entertainment. On the topic of the project's genre, Lamar called it "human music".</p>
